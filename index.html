    <p class="role">CUSTOMER SUCCESS MANAGER</p>
    <p>
      I am a technical customer success professional with over 7 years of
      experience delivering outstanding service. My skills include
      communication, attention to detail, and high adaptability, which I have
      demonstrated by achieving NPS scores of 95%+ for customer satisfaction at
      Apple and Kantar, respectively. Outside of my job I have had the pleasure
      of building websites for small businesses using front end programming
      tools and frameworks. My career has allowed me to work with clients from
      different sectors, including Marketing, Finance, broadcasting, retail, and
      technology, across EMEA and the US.
